# 0x05. NodeJS Basics

## Description
This project is an introduction to NodeJS, where we learn the fundamentals of running JavaScript code in a server environment. It includes basic file operations, HTTP server creation using both the native HTTP module and Express, and asynchronous programming.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Run JavaScript using NodeJS.
- Use NodeJS modules.
- Utilize specific NodeJS modules to read files.
- Access command-line arguments and environment variables using `process`.
- Create a small HTTP server using NodeJS.
- Create a small HTTP server using ExpressJS.
- Create advanced routes with ExpressJS.
- Use ES6 with NodeJS through Babel.
- Use Nodemon for faster development.

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Node.js (version 12.x.x).
- Code must be tested using Jest with `npm run test`.
- Linting is enforced with ESLint.
- Each function/class must be exported using `module.exports = myFunction;`.
- The project structure should follow best practices, separating concerns between routes, controllers, and utilities.

## Provided Files
- `database.csv`: CSV file containing sample data for students.
- `package.json`: Contains the project dependencies and scripts.
- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration.
- `babel.config.js`: Babel configuration.

## Installation
